1. I (James) worked on steps 1-6. Molly worked on steps 4-6.

2. These steps can be verified by compiling the project with the shell script and running it in the simulator. Typing dir in the command line will list the directory contents. Typing del filename will change the first char of the filename to \0 in the directory and change all the map entries it was occupying to 0. Typing copy filename1 filename2 will create a duplicate file of file 1. The type command can be used to verify that the contents of the second file are the same as the first. Typing create textfl will prompt the user for a line of text until enter is hit twice. It is then stored into a file, and can be verified by using the type command with textfl.
